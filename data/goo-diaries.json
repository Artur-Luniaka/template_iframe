    "content": "After 3 months of practice, I finally achieved my goal of completing the Rainbow Road level in under 2 minutes! The key was learning to use the momentum mechanics to my advantage. I discovered that if you time your jumps perfectly with the jelly's natural bounce, you can maintain incredible speed through the entire level.",
    "tips": [
      "Practice the timing of your jumps on easier levels first",
      "Use the walls to bounce and maintain momentum",
      "Don't be afraid to take risks - speed is everything",

    "content": "I've been experimenting with the new color-shifting mechanics, and wow! The visual effects are absolutely stunning. I found that certain color combinations work better for different types of obstacles. Purple seems to work best for speed sections, while green gives you better control for precision jumps.",
    "tips": [
      "Purple = Speed boost, perfect for straight sections",
      "Green = Better control, great for obstacle courses",
      "Blue = Enhanced jumping ability",
      "Red = Temporary invincibility against certain obstacles"

The level features a unique mechanic where you have to bounce between moving platforms while avoiding color-coded obstacles. The community response has been incredible!",
    "tips": [
      "Start with simple mechanics and build complexity gradually",
      "Test your level thoroughly before publishing",

I managed to collect every power-up, hit every bonus target, and finish with zero damage taken. The key was using the new Jelly Clone power-up strategically to collect items that would otherwise be out of reach.",

The haptic feedback makes every jump feel satisfying, and the controls are so intuitive that I can play one-handed while commuting. This is exactly what mobile gaming should be!",
